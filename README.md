# Exile - display free font
 Exile is a display stencil font inspired by music and iconic logo of The Rolling Stones.
I thought it would be a great challenge to design bands' custom font for fun as my personal project. My idea was to design stencil typeface becouse of its utility. It needed to be bold and loud without compromises in design ‒ it needed to be all caps. The contrast between swashy, soft tongue-like elements and sharp, heavy slab serifs give it unique look I was looking for. Its name comes from one of my favourite Stones' album "Exile On Main St."
